# Exori

What is EXORI?

Exori is an alternative server based on the Tibia game, we use an open code that emulates several features of the game in question, hence the name Open Tibia.
We have adapted the game so that you can communicate with the recent fever of NFTs and Crypto currencies, bringing opportunities to everyone who wants to play, hold and trade using our currency EXO Coin.
We are currently emulating the 12.7x version of the global version, but we will always update as far as possible to newer versions. We will prioritize fixing bugs before each major update. We have some differences regarding the way the game progresses to allow everyone to have fun and profit from their investment.

When?

The Open Beta will be released on the 10th and will be open until the 25th. 
OPEN BETA IS READY TO PLAY
